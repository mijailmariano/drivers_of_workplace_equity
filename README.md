### **<u>Project Description & Goals:</u>**

In this analysis, I use socioeconomic data at the state county level to understand local communities social-mobility health and how these factors contribute to company-employee attrition.


The socioeconomic data for this analysis was acquired from Harvard University's "Opportunity Atlas" platform. In collaboration with the US Census Bereau and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - the Opportunity Atlas tracks anonymized metrics of social-mobility at the local level for children born in the years from 1978 - 1983. 

The employee dataset of a medium sized business used in this analysis was generated by IBM's AI "Watson" as a way to help business practioners investigate potential drivers of employee attrition.

#### **<u>``In Brief:``</u>**

1. I first acquired the IBM Employee Dataset from Kaggle.com 
2. I then establish the geographical location for this dataset to be New York, NY (midtown area) and inspect the each employees' recorded "distance from work"
3. I filter and acquire socioeconomic data for counties within a 30 mile radius of the farthest employee commute in the IBM dataset

| ``County``                    | ``State ``    |
| ----                          | ----          |
| Fairfield County              | CT            |
| Bergen County                 | NJ            |
| Essex County                  | NJ            |
| Hudson County                 | NJ            |
| Middlesex County              | NJ            |
| Morris County                 | NJ            |
| Passaic County                | NJ            |
| Union County                  | NJ            |
| Bronx County                  | NY            |
| Kings County                  | NY            |
| Nassau County                 | NY            |
| New York County               | NY            |
| Queens County                 | NY            |
| Richmond County               | NY            |
| Rockland County               | NY            |
| Suffolk County                | NY            |
| Westchester County            | NY            |

4. I bin counties into five (5) distinct commute areas by range in miles from New York, NY (office location)
5. I then randomly assign each employee in the IBM dataset to a potential home-of-record county based on their commute distance
6. I then merge the two datasets (IBM & Opportunity Atlas) by county and assigned each employee/county their respective socioeconomic/social-mobility metric

| **``County-level Social-mobility Metrics:``** |
| ----                                          | 
| Household Income at Age 35                    |
| Highschool Graduation Rate                    |
| Percentage Married at Age 35                  |
| Incarceration Rate                            |
| Women Teenage Birth Rate                      |
| Poverty Rate                                  |
| Employment Rates at Age 35                    |
| Percentage of Single Parents                  |   


7. I use an “Inter-Quartile Range” (IQR) method to determine outliers in the dataset and filter out upperbound outliers found in employee records
8. I create and test statistical hypotheses to explore potential socioeconomic/mobility factors in company-employee attrition
9. I generate, deploy, and evaluate six (6) unique non-linear machine learning models to determine the predictability accuracy of employee attrition
10. I deploy the best performing model as measured by total accuracy and sensitivity 
11. I comclude that commonly recorded employee data combined with county-level socioeconomic can contribute to predicting company-employee attrition better than a baseline mode prediction
11. Lastly, I summarize my findings and generate recommendations for follow-on analysis and implementation of these insights

### **<u>Exploration Questions:</u>**


* How much does an employee's geographical background (where they live or grow-up) impact their decision to remain or leave their company?

* Are there socioeconomic/employee demographic differences between those employees who leave the company and those who remain?

* How can organizations think about employee attrition in the context of local-counties social-mobility?

### **<u>Repository Roadmap:</u>**

Below is a GitHub repository roadmap and breakdown of the key files needed to navigate this anlysis. All code, data synthesis, and models can be found here for future reproduction or improvement recommendations:

1. **final_report.ipynb**

   Data Science pipeline overview document. Project artifact of the hypothesis tests conducted, regression techniques used for machine learning models, key analysis takeaways, and recommendations.

2. **exploration_and_modeling.ipynb**

   Jupyter Notebook used as the data science pipeline file which walks-through the process for creating the necessary data acquisition and cleaning functions.

3. **acquire.py** 
  
   Python module file that imports the neccessary Zillow real-estate dataset and subsequent feature for modeling phase in the analysis. If just using or running the final_report.ipynb file, then this corresponding acquire.py file should suffice and the prepare.py file will not be needed.
   
   **Note:** you must first import the initial Zillow dataset from MySQL. When passed in the "acquire.get_zillow_dataset()" function, the data is then stored locally as a .csv file - then referenced as a pd.Dataframe thereafter. 

4. **prepare.py**

     Python module file with created functions needed to clean, and manipulate the Zillow dataset used in this analysis.

    Fraction of women who grew up in this area who claimed ever a child who was born when the women were between the ages of 13 and 19 as a dependent when filing taxes.

**Fraction Married at Age 35**

    Fraction of children who grew up in this area who are married in 2015 (in their mid-30s).
